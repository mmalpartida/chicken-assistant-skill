Companion skill to the heihei voice assistant robot project

## About
This is an upgrade to the HeiHei Chicken project to add a servo controller, raspberry pi, and mycroft voice control.
Mainly a proof of concept and a way to teach myself about working with voice skills and servo controllers.


The servo controller used is the Pololu Maestro 6 channel for around $20 USD
